_Engine Size Sales Value_ – Revenue distribution by engine displacement.

_Fuel Type Pricing Overview_ – Comparison of sales value across petrol, diesel, and hybrid vehicles.

_Sales Value by Model_ – Top-performing models by revenue contribution.

Additionally, the dashboard includes interactive slicers and timelines for:

_Year of Manufacture_: Focus on specific model years or ranges to analyze trends over time.

_Manufacturer_: Drill down into the performance of individual car brands.

_Model/Engine/Fuel Type_: Explore sales performance by specific models, engine sizes, or fuel types

**Key findings:** 
1. _Sales by Manufacturer_: Toyota leads with £180M, followed by Ford (£159.6M), VW (£154.5M), BMW (£121.3M), and Porsche (£75.9M).
Total sales across all manufacturers reached £691M.

2. _Sales Per Production Year_: Older models (1980s–1990s) had low sales, while recent models (2015–2020) drove most revenue.
Peak sales for most manufacturers occurred between 2015 and 2018.

3. _Engine Size Sales Value_: Most revenue came from medium-sized engines (1.4–3.0L), suggesting strong market preference for balanced performance.
Larger engines (4–5L) contributed significantly for premium brands like BMW and Porsche.

# Project 3

**Title:** [Product Sales Performance Report](https://github.com/Sheyi04/Sheyi04.github.io/blob/main/Product%20Sales%20Performance%20Report.pbix)

**Tools Used:** Power BI Desktop (Column Chart, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Donut Chart, Table Visual, Card Visual, Slicer, Visual formatting & dashboard layout, Basic DAX Measures)

**Project Description:** This project presents a Power BI dashboard that analyzes product sales performance over a three-month period (September–November).
